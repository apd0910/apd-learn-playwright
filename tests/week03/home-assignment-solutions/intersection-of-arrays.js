/* Assignment Requirements: 
1. Write a function named `intersection` that accepts two arguments, `arr1` and `arr2`, which are 
arrays of numbers, and returns an array of their intersection. 
2. Ensure no duplicate elements in the resulting array. If an element appears in both `arr1` and 
`arr2`, it should appear only once in the result. 
3. Use a loop to find common elements. Iterate through each element of `arr1` and check if it is 
present in `arr2` and not already included in the result array. 
4. Include example calls to the `intersection` function with different arrays to demonstrate the 
functionâ€™s functionality. Include examples with no common elements, all elements common, and 
typical cases. 
 
Expected Outcome: 
Upon completion, you should be able to: 
- Understand the concept of arrays and loops in JavaScript. 
- Demonstrate the calculation of intersection for various array inputs, handling both typical and 
edge cases. */
